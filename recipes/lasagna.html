    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken breasts in a light cajun and cilantro cream sauce are best served
      with cubed red potatoes and green beans or asparagus.
    </p>
    <p>Dish can also be served over rice, pasta, or egg noodles.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 thin skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning, divided</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>4 green onions, sliced</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, sliced</li>
      <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
      <li>¾ cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>½ cup halved cherry tomatoes</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pat chicken breasts dry and sprinkle with 1/2 the Cajun seasoning, salt,
        and pepper. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken to
        the very hot oil and cook, turning occasionally, until juices run clear
        when chicken is pricked with a fork and both sides are browned, 5 to 7
        minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside, reserving drippings
        in the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add green onions and bell pepper to the drippings in the skillet. Cook
        until tender, about 1 minute. Add chicken broth and wine and bring to a
        boil, about 5 minutes. Simmer until juices have reduced to about 3/4
        cup, about 5 minutes more. Add cream and continue to simmer to reduce
        slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and cilantro, plus remaining
        Cajun seasoning. Season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add chicken to the skillet, cover, and cook until heated through, about
        3 minutes more.
      </li>
    </ol>
